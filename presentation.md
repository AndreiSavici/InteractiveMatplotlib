Parts of a figure
-----------------
![anatomy of matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/_images/anatomy.png)

There are several components of a matplotlib image:

* **Figure** - the base container (think the page)
* **Axes** - a set of coordinates. You can have several axes per figure
* **Axis** - the spines, ticks, labels on an axis
* **Artist** - every object that can be rendered
